### An overview and demonstration of Airflow

The `Dockerfile` is based on the awesome `docker/airflow` repo by [puckel](https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow)

Some bits from the `custom operators` section are taken from [Michal Karzynski's Blog](http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2017/03/19/developing-workflows-with-apache-airflow/)
